            <p>Maintaining good health is essential for a happy and fulfilling life. Start by adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Regular exercise, such as walking, jogging, or yoga, can improve your physical and mental well-being. Prioritize sleep by aiming for 7-9 hours of rest each night to allow your body to recover and rejuvenate. Manage stress through mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises.
